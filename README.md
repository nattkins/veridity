# Veridity: Blockchain Verification Infrastructure

> **Mission**: Creating unfakeable institutional verification across all domains where truth matters

## 🌍 The Veridity Ecosystem

Veridity provides blockchain-based verification infrastructure for institutions requiring cryptographic truth and correctable justice.



### **Current Development**
- **🎓(https://github.com/nattkins/veridity-edu-credentials) Academic/research patent protection Academic verification using ENS/EAS/IPFS

### **Planned Domains**

- **📃 [Education Credentials](https://github.com/nattkins/veridity-edu-credentials)** - Academic/ technical certifcation verification using ENS/EAS/IPFS and Heritage NFT: Soul-bound tokens for ownership and corrections
- **🏥 Healthcare Records** - Medical credential verification
- **⚖️ Legal Documents** - Legal document authentication  
- **🏢 Professional Licensing** - Professional certification verification
- **🔬 Research Integrity** - Academic research verification

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

All Veridity domains share common patterns:

### **"Correctable Immutability"**
- **ENS Delegation**: Hierarchical institutional truth
- **EAS Attestations**: Correctable records with audit trails
- **IPFS Storage**: Immutable documentation and methodology


### **Universal Principles**
1. **Institutional Autonomy**: Organizations control their own verification
2. **Permanent Accessibility**: Survives institutional changes
3. **Transparent Appeals**: Clear correction processes with full audit trails
4. **Ecosystem Composability**: Reusable patterns across domains

## 🎯 Current Focus: Patent protectoin Credentials

Our first implementation focuses on patent protection as the foundational use case:

**Repository**: [veridity-rocrate-eth](https://github.com/nattkins/veridity-rocrate-eth)
**Scope**: Blockchain-verified research metadata and patent protection 

## 🚀 Development Timeline

### **Phase 1: Educational Foundation (2025)**
- Complete educational credentials implementation
- Establish ENS delegation patterns
- Create reusable EAS schemas
- Build university partnership framework

### **Phase 2: Pattern Replication (2026)**
- Extract common verification patterns
- Develop cross-domain architecture
- Begin healthcare and legal domain exploration

### **Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (2027+)**
- Full multi-domain implementation
- Global institutional adoption
- Decentralized governance framework
