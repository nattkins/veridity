# Veridity Right to Work Certification

**Status**: ðŸ†• **New Use Case Development**
**Timeline**: Possible Phase 3 integration

## Planned Focus
Verifying an individual's legal authorization to work in a specific country or jurisdiction, streamlining employment verification processes for employers.

## The Problem Addressed
Companies often face significant challenges in verifying the right to work for new hires. This includes:
- Manual, time-consuming checks of various documents (passports, visas, work permits).
- Potential for fraudulent documents.
- Burden on HR departments to stay updated with changing immigration laws.
- Compliance risks for employers if checks are inadequate.
- Difficulty for individuals to prove their status efficiently and privately.

## Veridity Solution Architecture
Leveraging Veridity's core components to create a secure, verifiable, and efficient "Right to Work" credential:

-   **ENS Identity**: `[country_code].workrights.status.eth` (e.g., `uk.workrights.status.eth`, `us.workrights.status.eth`) for jurisdictional work status namespaces.
-   **EAS Attestations**: Issued by official government bodies or authorized agencies, attesting to an individual's legal status to work. This could include:
    *   Citizenship verification.
    *   Visa or work permit status.
    *   Specific employment conditions or restrictions.
-   **IPFS Storage**: Securely storing encrypted or tokenized references to the underlying official documents or verification data, accessible only by authorized parties (e.g., employer, with individual's consent).
-   **Heritage NFTs**: Representing the individual's verified right to work status, providing a portable and verifiable credential that can be presented to employers.
-   **Potential Integration**: Linking with government databases or identity verification services to issue these attestations.

## Potential Features
-   **Instant Verification**: Employers can instantly verify an applicant's right to work via the Heritage NFT or EAS attestation.
-   **Privacy-Preserving**: Individuals control who can access their work status verification.
-   **Reduced Fraud**: Blockchain immutability makes it difficult to falsify work status.
-   **Streamlined Onboarding**: Simplifies the HR process for new hires.
-   **Dynamic Updates**: Ability to update statuses (e.g., visa expiry, new permits) via EAS corrections.

## Potential Partners
-   Government immigration and work permit agencies.
-   National identity verification services.
-   HR tech platforms and payroll providers.
-   Employers and recruitment agencies.

## Unique Challenges & Considerations
-   **Data Privacy & Security**: Handling highly sensitive personal and immigration data requires robust encryption and access control.
-   **Legal & Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with all relevant immigration and data protection laws in each jurisdiction.
-   **Government Adoption**: Requires buy-in and integration from official government bodies.
-   **Digital Identity Infrastructure**: Relies on the availability and trustworthiness of underlying digital identity solutions.

*This use case addresses a significant real-world problem by providing a secure and efficient mechanism for verifying an individual's legal ability to work.*
