# Veridity: Blockchain Verification Infrastructure

> **Mission**: Creating unfakeable institutional verification across all domains where truth matters

## üåç The Veridity Ecosystem

Veridity provides blockchain-based verification infrastructure for institutions requiring cryptographic truth and correctable justice.

### **Current Development**
- **üéì [Education Credentials](https://github.com/your-username/veridity-edu-credentials)** - Academic verification using ENS/EAS/IPFS
  - Status: **Grant application submitted** to Ethereum Foundation (¬£50,000)
  - Partners: Cardiff University, Imperial College London
  - Timeline: 12-month development cycle

### **Planned Domains**
- **üè• Healthcare Records** - Medical credential verification
- **‚öñÔ∏è Legal Documents** - Legal document authentication  
- **üè¢ Professional Licensing** - Professional certification verification
- **üî¨ Research Integrity** - Academic research verification

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

All Veridity domains share common patterns:

### **"Correctable Immutability"**

- **EAS Attestations**: Correctable records with audit trails
- **IPFS Storage**: Immutable documentation and methodology
- **Heritage NFTs**: Soul-bound tokens for ownership and corrections

### **Universal Principles**
1. **Institutional Autonomy**: Organizations control their own verification
2. **Permanent Accessibility**: Survives institutional changes
3. **Transparent Appeals**: Clear correction processes with full audit trails
4. **Ecosystem Composability**: Reusable patterns across domains

# Veridity Core Architecture

## Universal Patterns Across All Domains

### **"Correctable Immutability" Framework**

All Veridity implementations follow the same core pattern:

```
ENS Domain (Institutional Truth)
    ‚Üì
EAS Attestation (Correctable Records)
    ‚Üì
IPFS Storage (Immutable Documentation)
    ‚Üì
Heritage NFT (Individual Ownership)
```

## Component Specifications

### **1. ENS Delegation Hierarchy**
```
[credential].[field].[institution].[domain].eth

Examples:
- distinction.MSc.engineering.imperial-college.university.eth
- specialist.cardiology.nhs.healthcare.eth
- chartered.engineer.ice.professional.eth
- partner.commercial-law.magic-circle.legal.eth
```

### **2. EAS Attestation Schema**
```solidity
struct VeridityAttestation {
    address recipient;        // Individual credential holder
    string ensCredential;     // ENS domain for this credential
    bytes32 ipfsHash;        // IPFS documentation hash
    uint256 issuedDate;      // Original issuance timestamp
    uint256 expiryDate;      // Expiration (if applicable)
    bool isRevoked;          // Revocation status
    string correctionReason; // Reason for any corrections
}
```

### **3. Heritage NFT Standard**
```solidity
interface IHeritageNFT {
    function mint(address recipient, string ensCredential) external;
    function addCorrection(uint256 tokenId, string reason, bytes32 newHash) external;
    function getHistory(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (Correction[]);
}
```

### **4. IPFS Storage Structure**
```json
{
  "credential": {
    "type": "academic|medical|legal|professional",
    "issuer": "institution_identifier",
    "recipient": "individual_identifier",
    "content": "credential_specific_data",
    "methodology": "verification_process",
    "requirements": "completion_criteria"
  },
  "verification": {
    "timestamp": "issuance_date",
    "validators": ["list_of_validators"],
    "evidence": "supporting_documentation"
  },
  "governance": {
    "appeals_process": "correction_methodology",
    "authority": "issuing_institution",
    "standards": "compliance_framework"
  }
}
```

## Cross-Domain Reusability

### **Shared Components**
- ENS delegation management contracts
- EAS schema templates
- Heritage NFT base implementation
- IPFS integration utilities

### **Domain-Specific Customization**
- Verification criteria and standards
- Appeals and correction processes
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Partner integration protocols

## Implementation Sequence

### **Phase 1: Education (Current)**
- Establish core patterns
- Validate institutional partnerships
- Create reusable smart contracts
- Demonstrate regulatory compliance

### **Phase 2: Healthcare & Legal**
- Adapt privacy and regulatory requirements
- Extend verification methodologies
- Build sector-specific partnerships
- Create specialized governance frameworks

### **Phase 3: Professional & Industry**
- Scale to multiple certification bodies
- Develop employer integration APIs
- Create cross-domain verification
- Build global recognition networks

This architecture ensures each domain builds on proven patterns while enabling sector-specific requirements and compliance.
